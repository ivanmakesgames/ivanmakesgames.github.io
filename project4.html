								  <b>Description</b>
								</div>
								<div class="accordion-content">
								  <p>"Am I Worthy?" is a simple 2D game for mobile devices. It consists of 4 levels that have a progressive increase in difficulty. The player must collect coins and overcome problems to survive this adventure. The main goal is to get as many coins/points as the user can to win the game. It is still possible to finish the game and reach the final point; however, if there are not enough points collected, the game session is considered failed.<br> <br>Important Note: This was my very first project and experience with Unity Engine.

									<ul>
										<li>LEVEL DESIGN:<br>
											Designed and crafted four distinct levels with unique environments, incorporating environmental storytelling elements to enhance player immersion and engagement.</li><br>
										<li>SCORING SYSTEM:<br>
											Developed a comprehensive scoring system that accurately tracks and calculates points based on the player's actions, such as collecting coins and defeating enemies. This scoring system is made to measure the player's progress and success, providing a clear indication of whether the game was completed successfully or not.</li><br>
										<li>OBSTACLES AND POWERUPS:<br>
											Implemented a dynamic lava obstacle that poses a threat to the player, deducting one life per second if the player comes into contact with it, adding an element of urgency and risk-reward gameplay. Placed strategically hidden powerups, including shooting abilities and health kits, throughout different parts of the levels, encouraging exploration and rewarding the player for their curiosity and skill.</li><br>
										<li>MAIN MENU AND FINAL SCENE:<br>
											Added a main menu that provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for players to navigate the game. Final Level that concludes weather the game was completed or not.</li>
